Practicing CI/CD using github actions

*GitHub actions:*  GitHub Actions is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to automate various tasks and workflows related to your software development process. It enables you to create custom workflows, define triggers, and execute various actions in response to events like code commits, pull requests, issues, and more. You can use GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy your code, as well as perform other tasks like sending notifications, generating documentation, and more. These workflows are defined in YAML files stored in your repository, and they can be tailored to meet your project's specific needs.
